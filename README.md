## NOTES:

- manually install the **pre-release** version of https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wasm-wasi-core
  (automatic installation doesn't work because this extension doesn't have a release version yet)

- syntax highlighting support based on https://github.com/mborik/z80-macroasm-vscode/blob/main/syntaxes/z80-macroasm.tmLanguage.json
